Vivek:  Hey there, Arun! How's it going?

Arun:   Hey Vivek, doing good! Hi Harsha, what's up?

Harsha: Hey Arun, Vivek! Just diving into some Java 8 features lately.
        It's fascinating how Java embraced functional programming with version 1.8.
        I've been particularly intrigued by Lambda Expressions.

Vivek:  Ah, Lambda Expressions! They're quite the game-changer.
        But for those who might not be familiar, what exactly are Lambda Expressions?

Arun:   Well, think of Lambda Expressions as a neat way to write quick, anonymous functions on the fly.
        They're like the arrow functions you'd find in JavaScript.
        You define parameters within parentheses, add a hyphen and arrow, and then encapsulate your function logic within curly braces.

Harsha: Exactly! And one crucial point to note is that Lambda Expressions work seamlessly with Functional Interfaces.
        So, what exactly qualifies as a Functional Interface?

Vivek:  A Functional Interface is simply an interface with just one abstract method.
        This simplicity allows Lambda Expressions to seamlessly integrate, as the JVM knows precisely which method to execute.

Harsha: Spot on, Vivek!
        And here's the beauty of Lambda syntax: it's flexible. If you have a single parameter, you can skip the parentheses.
        Plus, if your function logic fits in one line, you can even skip the curly braces.

Arun:   Ah, that clears things up! But what are the advantages of using Lambda Expressions?

Vivek:  Oh, there are plenty! Firstly, they bring conciseness to the table.
        With optional syntax and on-the-go implementation, your code becomes more readable and compact,
        then there's the functional programming aspect we discussed earlier, making code easier to test and reason about.

Harsha: And let's not forget performance!
        Lambda Expressions can actually enhance performance compared to traditional anonymous inner classes.
        How so? Well, they eliminate the overhead of creating and invoking a new class instance,
        especially for short, simple functions.

Arun:   Hold on, could you elaborate on this overhead with creating and invoking a new class instance?

Harsha: Sure thing! Back in the day,
        if we needed to implement an interface, we'd have to create a class, implement the interface,
        and define the method. Then, whenever we needed to use that method,
        we'd have to create an object of that class and call the method. It was quite a hassle and resource-intensive.

Vivek:  Exactly! Lambda Expressions streamline this process, cutting out the unnecessary overhead and simplifying our codebase.

Arun:   Wow, that's quite insightful! No wonder Lambda Expressions have become such a staple in modern Java development.

Harsha: Absolutely! And they're just one piece of the functional programming puzzle that Java 8 introduced.
        It's exciting to see how these features continue to shape the landscape of Java development.

Vivek:  Indeed! And with Java constantly evolving, who knows what other innovations lie ahead?

Arun:   Yeah, lets then connect in another podcast. See you all.
